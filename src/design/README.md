### Design

The raw series for design matrices and outcomes, wherein all measures are at NHS Trust level, are available at

* [warehouse/design/raw](../../warehouse/design/raw)

Each *data file* has the data of a single NHS Trust, hence each file's name is the trust code.  The data is explorable
via [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/greyhypotheses) graphs; the
explorable options are

* Hospital Activity & Estimated Cases
* Estimated Vaccination & Case Measures
* Estimated Trust Level Cases by Age Group
